        <h2>Facial Recognition & Civil Liberties</h2>
        <p>Understanding the Impact: Facial recognition systems often exhibit biases against certain demographics, leading to misidentification and unjust consequences.
        </p>
        <p>Potential Consequences: Biased facial recognition can result in wrongful arrests, surveillance of marginalized communities, and erosion of privacy rights.
        </p>
        <p>Data & Insights:</p>
        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took legal action against the widespread use of unreliable and biased facial recognition technology in Detroit. In a lawsuit filed on December 15, 2020, the ACLU highlighted the dangers of misidentification and wrongful arrests caused by flawed facial recognition systems (ACLU, 2020).</p>
        <p>Case study:</p>
        <p>In 2020, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reported a case where a Black man in Detroit was wrongfully arrested due to a flawed facial recognition match. The system misidentified him as a suspect in a shoplifting case, leading to his unjust detention. This incident underscores the dangers of relying on biased facial recognition technology, especially when it disproportionately affects marginalized communities.</p>
