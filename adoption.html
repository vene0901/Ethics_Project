            <h2>AI Adoption</h2>
            <h3>Implication 1</h3>
            <p>When you are looking at adopting AI in the workforce you are looking at some econoic impacts. For example you could possibly see that there are job automations where AI can automate routine and reprtitive tasks. This can untilmately lead to job displaccements in sectors like manufacturing, customer service, and data entry. However, it can also create new jobs in AI development, maintence and oversight.
                Something else that we are able to see as an implication is productivity gains. based on our previous point we are able to see that by automating processes and enhancing decision making algorithms, AI can significantly boost productivity and effecieny in business, leading to economic growth.
                We are also able to see that there are many changes in global power dynamics. One of these being technology leadership where nations leading AI technology development gain significant economic and strategic advances, as mentioned above. This can also potentially shift global power dyna,ics. 
                Something else that impacts global power is geopolitical tensions. The race for AI dominance can lead to geopolitical tensions, especially concerning AI's use in defecnce and intelligence. The biggestest of stake holders being the government because of the power that they would be able to have to control and find data on people that are high risk to the government and others. 
            </p>
            <h3>Implication 2</h3>
            <p>A big stakeholder when it comes to making sure that AI is efficient and accurate has to be the healthcare side of AI. One thing that we have to look into for healthcare that is big is making sure that the diagnosis and the treatment are accurate. For example, AI can analyze medical data to assist in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and personalizing treatment plans which overall improves the quality of healthcare that is being provided to people. 
                Along with this we are looking at drug discovery. AI can accelerate the drug discovery process by identifying potential drug candidates faster and at a lower cost. These are really big when it comes to trying to make sure that all the facts and details are included when testing out new medication. 
                Within the healthcare departments we are able to also see changes in social dynamics where AI-driven social media algorithms can influence the public opinion and social norms. This can mean that when a healthcare provider uses social media and the video starts to get a lot of views, they can influence many people and help out by giving tips that most doctors would not suggest right away. Another way that we are able to see this is with human and machine interactions. 
                As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the nature of human interaction and relationship with technology evolves, impacting social behavior and communication. 
            </p>
            <h3>Implication 3</h3>
            <p>Another implication that we are able to see is through art and creativity. AI is able to assist artists, musicians and writers by providing tools for creating art, music and literature, expanding the boundaries of creativity. We can see this not only in the workforce but as well as in education when students need help trying to come up with an idea or a piece for their art.
                For intellectual property the creation of original works by AI raises questions about intellectual property rights and the definition of authorship. With this it raises more questions on ethical implications that can arise from using AI in art. 
                Specifically we are able to see that AI systems can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases if they are trained on bias data, leading to unfair treatment in areas like hiring, law enforcement, and lending. These are big ethical reasons that could become very unethical with a wrong move. There are many ways in which someone is able to make sure that there are no ethical or biases with AI but there should still be much caution. 
                Autonomous decision making is the delegation of critical decisions to AI. Many include autonomous vehicles or military drones, which raise ethical concerns about accountability and the value of human oversight.
